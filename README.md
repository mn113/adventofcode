# Advent of Code 2016-2022

Parent repo for all my [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions repos.

Advent of Code is a problem-solving challenge across 25 days each December. I have tended to solve it each year within December, and let it lie dormant for 11 months.

## Contents

| year | completion (stars/50) | description |
| ---- | :-------------------: | ----------- |
| [2016](https://github.com/mn113/adventofcode2016) | 47 | First participation. Solved using only Python. |
| [2017](https://github.com/mn113/adventofcode2017) | 50 | Solved in Ruby, Python, Elixir **(new)** |
| [2018](https://github.com/mn113/adventofcode2018) | 20 | Attempted in PHP. Lack of time to dedicate to solving. |

## Thoughts on solving languages

- **Python**: best language for quick solves, or anything hairy needing lots of looping, BFS and OOP.
- **Ruby**: most compact & elegant syntax, adapts well to easy and hard problems. Nice depth to standard library.
- **Elixir**: sophisticated language which tends to produce robust and well-organised code. Though the advanced concepts have a learning curve.
- **Javascript**: useful for sticky situations, but too familiar from my day job!
- **PHP**: not a very good choice for FP-style because its array functions are so clunky.
- **Crystal**: feels too similar to Ruby. Will be nice to see if its types prevent bugs and its performance helps with long-running solutions.
